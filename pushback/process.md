# Process metaclass
A process is an object that has a 28-bit numeric ID and up to 65536 ports, each
of which may be connected to one other port on one other process. (Multiway
connections involve delegating to a dedicated process to manage
multicast/round-robin/etc.) Processes participate in a 64-bit address space that
describes their location in a distributed context:

```
<host_id : 20> <object_id : 28> <port_id : 16>
```


## Connecting to ports
A connection has exactly two endpoints and monopolizes each port it's connected
to. Connections are encoded as numbers assigned to port vectors within
processes:

```
# connect (object 4: port 43) to (object 91: port 7)
$$object4{ports}[43] = $localhost << 44 | 91 << 16 | 7;
$$object91{ports}[7] = $localhost << 44 | 4
